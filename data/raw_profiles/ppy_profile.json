            "summary": "Recent activities in the osu repository have focused on addressing critical issues and refining game features. This includes a fix for the slider event generator incorrectly not generating repeats when tick distance is zero, rounding object coordinates to nearest integers on legacy export, and preventing a forced miss on a slider with strict tracking active if tracking is lost before the head was judged. Additionally, a change has been made to pause playback when entering gameplay test from the editor, and other minor issues have been resolved."
