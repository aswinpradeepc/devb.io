The first, titled 'RFC: Redesign io_uring async flow', aims to redesign the io_uring asynchronous flow to address issues with submission queue overflows. It presents a detailed analysis of the current implementation and proposes a new design that batches sequential write operations to alleviate pressure on the submission queue. The second pull request, titled 'Use Self where possible', appears to be a retry of a previous pull request (#433) and aims to utilize self where possible in the codebase."
