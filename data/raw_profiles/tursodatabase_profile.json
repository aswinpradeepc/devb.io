            "summary": "Recent activities in the tursodatabase/limbo repository include multiple push events and pull requests focusing on the implementation of generic functions, support for uncorrelated subqueries, and the addition of a remainder vdbe opcode. These changes also include updates to the COMPAT.md file and the introduction of column aliases. Notably, a pull request added support for like functions with escape and another worked on the handling of subqueries, allowing them to be treated as wrappers of a SelectPlan that yield from a subroutine, enhancing query capabilities."
