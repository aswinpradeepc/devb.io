The update involves changing imports from .ts to .js, configuring Jest and Docusaurus/Webpack, adding a tsconfig.load.json for the /load entry point, and updating the just build process to temporarily rewrite load.ts imports and generate artifacts. This change aims to add support for TypeScript 4.x and 'node' module resolution by fixing import extension handling, addressing the TS2691 errors in earlier versions."
